TODO:
~1. Inspect current layout export workflow and identify reusable components for PNG output.~
~2. Implement image-based layout rendering that mirrors the PDF path.~
~3. Integrate PNG layout export into the dialog flow with file saving and messaging.~
~4. Test export paths (PDF/PNG/JPEG) to ensure regressions are avoided (build verified; runtime still pending manual check).~
